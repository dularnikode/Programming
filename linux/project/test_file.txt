The word "leadership" can bring to mind a variety of images. For example:
A political leader, pursuing a passionate, personal cause.
An explorer, cutting a path through the jungle for the rest of his group to follow.
An executive, developing her company's strategy to beat the competition.
Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things.
They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new.
Leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to "win" as a team or an organization; and it is dynamic, exciting, and inspiring.
Yet, while leaders set the direction, they must also use management skills to guide their people to the right destination, in a smooth and efficient way.
In this article, we'll focus on the process of leadership. 
In particular, we'll discuss the "transformational leadership" model, first proposed by James MacGregor Burns and then developed by Bernard Bass.
This model highlights visionary thinking and bringing about change, instead of management processes that are designed
to maintain and steadily improve current performance.
